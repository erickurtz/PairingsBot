Ladder Rules
===============================================

1. Obvious Stuff
-------------------------------
- I retain the right to change/violate any of these rules at
any time for any reason.

- Using an engine gets you banned.

- Being a jerk gets you banned

- Doing anything else I don't like could get you banned


2. Ladder movement
--------------------------------
-New players are added to the bottom of the ladder according to rating.
e.g.

If 2 new players join, the player with the higher rating is ranked n+1 while
the other player is n+2, n being the size of the ladder.

- Beating a player ranked above you moves you up to their ranking
and them down to yours.

- Beating a player ranked below you results in no movement

- Draws result in no movement

- Players can be moved up to accommodate other players being moved down or removed
for inactivity regardless of their game results.
This can allow players to move up quite a bit in one week. 

i.e. If a player ranked #17 beats another ranked #11 they move up to #11.
THEN, if players ranked 10-8 didn't play that week they move up
AGAIN to #8 to give room for the other players moving down.

3. Inactivity
-------------------------------
- Missing one week of the ladder will never result in you
being removed from the rankings

- Players in the bottom 20% who miss 2 weeks will be removed.

- Any player who misses 4 weeks will be removed.


4. Pairings
--------------------------------

- The lower ranked player will always play White.
For equally ranked players color will be assigned
at random

- If an odd number of players register the lowest ranked player will
get a bye. If the two lowest players are equally
ranked it will be decided at random

- Players will not be paired with another player they played in the previous 2
weeks.

- Players will be paired one at a time starting with the highest ranked.
They will be paired with the highest ranked player who they are allowed
to play.

- Unranked players will either be paired at random against each other or against the
- Players will be paired one at a time starting with the highest ranked.
They will be paired with the highest ranked player who they are allowed
to play.

- Unranked players will either be paired at random against each other or against the
lowest ranked player possible

- If the last 2 players to be paired are not allowed because they've recently played
then the second to last pairing will be changed to accommodate.(this has never actually
happened but is possible)

- Any of the above will be ignored if it makes correct pairings impossible
(this shouldn't ever happen but it's possible.)


Example:

Rank: Name(previous 2 opponents)
-------------------------------------
1. Aaron(Bob,Charlie)
2. Bob(Aaron,David )
3. Charlie(David,Aaron)
4. David(Charlie,Bob)
5. Evan(Frank,xxxx)
6. Frank(Evan,xxxx)

- Aaron can't play Bob or Charlie so he gets David.
- Bob plays Charlie
- uh oh, Evan can't play Frank and they are the only two left so we have to switch the Bob-Charlie game.
- So Bob plays the next available which is Evan and Frank plays Charlie.

David(white) vs Aaron(Black)
Evan(white) vs Bob(black)
Frank(white) vs. charlie(black)

Docker Commands
